name: Impossible Travel Detected Based on Sign-In Distance and Speed
description: >
  Detects potential account compromise by analyzing geographic distance
  and calculated travel speed between consecutive successful sign-ins
  for the same user. Alerts when a user appears to travel faster than
  possible between two sign-ins.
